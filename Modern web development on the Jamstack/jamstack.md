# Jamstack?

The modern way to build<br> [**websites** & _apps_]<br> that delivers better performance

^ Term created by Mathias Biilmann - 2016

# Jamstack?

- Only a new “buzzword”?
- Do I have to learn new frameworks all over again?

##[fit] **Jamstack** = _Javascript_ + Api + _Markup_ Stack

^ Not a new framework but a philosophy
Acronym

# Core principles #1

## _Pre-rendering_

- _Client side_ vs SSR vs _SSG_
- Prebuilt into highly optimized static pages and assets
- Deploy to _CDN_
- Only for static sites?

^ client side: white page in the browser -> load JS -> render
CDN => close to users / reduce latency / static resources

---

# Core principles #2

## _Decoupling_

- Use of APIs
- Flexibility

---

# Why Jamstack?

- Performance
- Security
- Scalability
- Maintainability
- Portability
- Developer experience
